<p class="st"><b>Hebrew, <span class="smcap">גי הנם (<i>geh hin·nom′, </i>“valley of Hinnom”); Greek, γέεννα (<i>ge′en·na</i>); Latin, <i>ge·hen′na</i></span><i></i></b></p>
<p class="sb">“Gehenna” means “valley of Hinnom,” for it is the Greek form of the Hebrew <i>geh hin·nom′</i>. In <a href="10_BI12_.JOS-split18.xhtml#chapter18_verse16">Jos 18:16</a>, where “valley of Hinnom” occurs, the Greek <i>Septuagint </i>reads “Gehenna.” It occurs 12 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures, first appearing in <a href="44_BI12_.MT-split5.xhtml#chapter5_verse22">Mt 5:22</a>. The <i>New World Translation </i>renders it “Gehenna” in all its occurrences, namely, in <a href="44_BI12_.MT-split5.xhtml#chapter5_verse22">Mt 5:22,</a><a href="44_BI12_.MT-split5.xhtml#chapter5_verse29"> 29, 30;</a><a href="44_BI12_.MT-split10.xhtml#chapter10_verse28"> 10:28;</a><a href="44_BI12_.MT-split18.xhtml#chapter18_verse9"> 18:9;</a><a href="44_BI12_.MT-split23.xhtml#chapter23_verse15"> 23:15,</a><a href="44_BI12_.MT-split23.xhtml#chapter23_verse33"> 33;</a><a href="45_BI12_.MR-split9.xhtml#chapter9_verse43"> Mr 9:43,</a><a href="45_BI12_.MR-split9.xhtml#chapter9_verse45"> 45,</a><a href="45_BI12_.MR-split9.xhtml#chapter9_verse47"> 47;</a><a href="46_BI12_.LU-split12.xhtml#chapter12_verse5"> Lu 12:5;</a><a href="63_BI12_.JAS-split3.xhtml#chapter3_verse6"> Jas 3:6</a>.</p>
<p class="sb">The valley of Hinnom became the dumping place and incinerator for the filth of Jerusalem. Bodies of dead animals were thrown in to be consumed in the fires to which sulphur, or brimstone, was added to assist the burning. Also bodies of executed criminals, who were considered undeserving of a decent burial in a memorial tomb, were thrown in. If such dead bodies landed in the fire they were consumed, but if their carcasses landed upon a ledge of the deep ravine their putrefying flesh became infested with worms, or maggots, which did not die until they had consumed the fleshy parts, leaving only the skeletons.</p>
<p class="sb">No living animals or human creatures were pitched into Gehenna to be burned alive or tormented. Hence, the place could never symbolize an invisible region where human souls are tormented eternally in literal fire or attacked forever by undying worms. Because the dead criminals cast there were denied a decent burial in a memorial tomb, the symbol of the hope of a resurrection, Gehenna was used by Jesus and his disciples to symbolize <i>everlasting destruction, annihilation from God’s universe, </i>or <i>“second death,” an eternal punishment</i>.</p>
